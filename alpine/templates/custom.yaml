# This is used to create a custom image
# It uses the property 'alpine-image'
# You can set this property like this:
#   lxops property set alpine-image images:alpine/3.18
# Configuration mainly installs packages
# Any other configuration can be done in the containers that are launched from this image,
# so the configuration can be easily refined without reinstalling packages and building a new image.
