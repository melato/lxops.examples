    basic tinyproxy container
    It just has tinyproxy, and attached disk devices
    It depends on two profiles which we do not define.
    the root profile should assign the root disk device, without any network
    the tinyproxy.network profile should have a proxy device that maps port 8888
    from the host to the container.
    To use:
    - enter a shell
    - edit /etc/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.conf
    - service tinyproxy start
profiles:
- root
- tinyproxy.network
cloud-config-files:
- ../base/nogetty.cfg
- ../base/sudo.cfg
